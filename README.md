If you are a windows user and require macOS to learn XCode, then you can transform your windows machine into the Hackintosh machine. Remember, this tutorial is for educational purpose. I will be not responsible for any damage done to your device while installing macOS. Do at your own risk. This tutorial is only for Hp EliteBook Folio 9470m.
<br>There are lots of videos on how to installing macOS on a device. So, instead of installation, I will be guiding you with the accurate BIOS setting and share my EFI files. Back up your important files before starting. Enjoy.!

So far everything is working smoothly, except the Bluetooth.
There are no drivers for Intel Wifi card. So, I replaced my Intel card with Atheros Qualcomm AR5B22.
This card is also available for different brand laptop. For HP laptop, buy the card with black label on it.
A picture of my WiFi card is given on your right.
