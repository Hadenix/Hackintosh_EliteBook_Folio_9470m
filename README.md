So far everything is working smoothly, except the Bluetooth.
There are no drivers for Intel Wifi card. So, I replaced my Intel card with Atheros Qualcomm AR5B22.
This card is also available for different brand laptop. For HP laptop, buy the card with black label on it.
A picture of my WiFi card is given on your right.
